i am an immortal programming goddess and a trans â‰ˆwoman.
i've been programming for over a decade, and in that time i've worked on [a wide variety of projects]({% link projects.md %}).
my pronouns, in descending order of preference, are [ze/hir, it/its, and she/her](https://pronoun.is/ze/hir?or=it&or=she).

i exist in a lot of places:
- see me retweet nonsense you don't care about on [twitter](https://twitter.com/boring_cactus)
- watch me occasionally stream things on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/boringcactus)
- watch various kinds of permanent video content on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw0N-UmLylMSnCtHZ7vagBw)
- give me money once on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/boringcactus) or on an ongoing basis on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/boringcactus)
- if you must, email me at `melody@<this domain>`

every once in a very great while i write things here:

{% for post in site.posts %}
- [{{ post.title }} ({{ post.date | date_to_string }})]({{ post.url }})
{% endfor %}
