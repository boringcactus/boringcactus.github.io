# boringcactus (Melody Horn)

i'm a programmer and a trans woman.
i've done some cool shit but it's under my deadname and i don't know how much of it is any good so i'm not talking about it here right now.

i mostly exist on [twitter](https://twitter.com/boring_cactus) retweeting good content and occasionally tweeting bad content.

every once in a very great while i write things here:

{% for post in site.posts %}
- [{{ post.title }} ({{ post.date | date_to_string }})]({{ post.url }})
{% endfor %}
